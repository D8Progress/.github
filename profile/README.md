# D8 Progress Organization

> **Deliber8 Progress (D8 Progress)** - Gamified goal tracking designed for neurodivergent brains

---

## 🎯 Mission

Traditional productivity apps fail neurodivergent users because they assume habits become automatic and punish missed days instead of celebrating wins. **D8 Progress is different.**

We're building a goal tracking platform specifically designed for ADHD, autistic, and other neurodivergent brains that provides:

- **Ongoing dopamine rewards** - XP, levels, and achievements for every action
- **Forgiveness mechanics** - Streak shields and grace periods, no shame spirals  
- **Flexible structure** - Multiple objective types that match how you actually work
- **Context-aware organization** - Goals scoped to life areas that matter to you
